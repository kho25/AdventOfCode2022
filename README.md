# AdventOfCode2022

These are my advent of code solutions for 2022
I did the first six days in Java. Then I realized that it was worth learning Python for AoC. 
So, I rewrote days 1-6 in python to learn the syntax and make them a little nicer. 
I probably will not revise my coming solutions, so have fun reading my jank code.
